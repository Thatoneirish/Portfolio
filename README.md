# Portfolio

I've made my portfolio to be easily digestible, being only a single page long for browser users. My goal with this is to show off tricks I've learned for making sites look nice. This will be a project I continue to update as I gain more experience and become more confident with my work.

I hope to someday have the placeholder text share my work experience in the coding community, and will eventually change out the avatar for something more professional once I have the money for photoshop.
